Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,
Given "egg", "add", return true.

Given "foo", "bar", return false.

Given "paper", "title", return true.



bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t)
{
        char map_s[128] = { 0 };
        char map_t[128] = { 0 };
        int len = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        {
            if (map_s[s[i]]!=map_t[t[i]]) return false;
            map_s[s[i]] = i+1;
            map_t[t[i]] = i+1;
        }
        return true; 
}
